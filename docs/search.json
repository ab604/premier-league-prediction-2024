    "text": "At the half-way point in the 2023/24 Premier League season, I was reading the ESPN article What’s wrong at Arsenal?. It’s really good and full complicated analysis using expected goals, heatmaps and the inevitable nod to AI. It ends on Arsenal’s chances of winning the league at 11% on January 5th 2024.\nI’d previously read Oliver Johnson’s Substack on New Year’s resolutions which included a binomial model of Ronny O’Sullivan’s frame win and match win rate.\nJust for fun, I wondered how a binomial model would compete with more sophisticated models for predicting the outcome of the second half of the season.\nSection 1.1 has the details, but if the top four hold their form, then a binomial model predicts Liverpool to win the league as shown in Table 1.\nIn the current season Manchester City with a 63% rate are performing well below their win rate of 76% and draw rate of 11% in the last six seasons.\nMeanwhile Liverpool have a win rate of 66% and draw rate of 21% over the same period which is close their current 65% win rate.\nAssuming there is regression to the mean, I also calculated Table 2 for their six season mean win rates for Manchester City and Liverpool for the remaining matches. In this scenario Manchester City beat Liverpool by two points.\nEither way, it would be a surprise if Aston Villa won the league. And an even bigger one if Arsenal somehow won.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Final predictions for 2023/24 season based on form from first half of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClub\nMatches\nPred. Wins\nPred.
